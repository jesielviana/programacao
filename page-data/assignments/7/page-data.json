To get proper syntax highlighting in Sublime Text, install <a href=\"https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Babel\">Babel</a> using <a href=\"https://packagecontrol.io\">Package Control</a>. Then in Sublime, change your highlighter by selecting View -> Syntax -> Babel -> JavaScript (Babel). This does <em>not</em> affect the way your code will function in any manner.</p>\n<h2>The Game of Life &#x26; ReactJS</h2>\n<p>Conway's Game of Life is a popular two-dimensional cell board simulation that, given a starting configuration and set of survival rules, evolves without any user input. You begin with any arrangement of <em>living</em> cells in a grid and start the simulation to watch how their individual state changes iteratively, relative to the cells surrounding them. It's actually pretty neat - take a look at how an example run looks below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_bazwyKf2FDM/Sm3hcNDUHRI/AAAAAAAACAM/WQJlB2rJg3A/gosper.gif\" alt=\"Neat image here\"></p>\n<p>You're going to build your own version of this using a frontend view library called ReactJS, or React, in conjunction with another library called Redux, which serves as a predictable state container for JavaScript apps and lets you write more robust, scalable frontend applications.</p>\n<p>Once you're done, the final application will look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AttFsM0.png\" alt=\"Final application photo\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Project Setup</h2>\n<p><strong>Using Node.js, Gulp, and Browserify</strong></p>\n<p>React developers use a language called JSX which acts as syntactic sugar for building HTML-like elements from scratch. While this makes a lot of the associated code easier to both write and understand intuitively, additional steps have to be taken to ensure web browsers can translate JSX into pure JavaScript.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Note: A server must to be used to host the files, since JSX is</code>\n<code class=\"language-text\">pre-compiled to JavaScript by a third-party transformer. To</code>\n<code class=\"language-text\">avoid cross-origin requests the files cannot be directly</code>\n<code class=\"language-text\">retrieved from local filepaths.</code></p>\n<p>This project will make use of several libraries to function correctly, and in order to import and manage all of them, Browserify and Gulp will come in handy.</p>\n<p>We'll use Browserify to allow us to use libraries from npm (such as lodash, React, Redux, or even async) on the browser. And we'll use Gulp to automate the otherwise tedious build process (basically, it will make it such that any time you save a frontend JS file, the gulp process will first convert all the JSX to pure JavaScript and then use Browserify to convert your node-style <code class=\"language-text\">require</code>'s and <code class=\"language-text\">module.exports</code>'s into a form the browser can understand. The result is one big build file located in <code class=\"language-text\">/public/build/main.js</code>, which contains the entire frontend application).</p>\n<p>To run and test the application in your browser, fire up the node server by running <code class=\"language-text\">npm start</code> and navigate to <code class=\"language-text\">localhost:3000/</code>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Part 0 - Application Overview</h2>\n<h3>0.1 Redux Application Architecture</h3>\n<p>First, take a look at the app's main entry point, located in <code class=\"language-text\">/public/main.jsx</code>. Here, you'll see some boilerplate for initializing a React application that uses Redux. The most important line is the one where we use React to render the top-level <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;GameOfLife&gt;</code> React component. You can find the code for <code class=\"language-text\">GameOfLife</code> in <code class=\"language-text\">/public/components/GameOfLife.jsx</code>.</p>\n<p>You'll notice that we implement a function called <code class=\"language-text\">onImportSeed</code> that delegates to the <code class=\"language-text\">dispatch</code> function of our Redux store, which has been passed in as a React prop, <code class=\"language-text\">this.props.store</code>. The idea here is that, when an action is performed on the React frontend, such as a button click to import a seed,  we dispatch a Redux action to update our application state. In this case the action is the one located at <code class=\"language-text\">actions.importSeed</code>.</p>\n<p>You're probably wondering what actions are and where they come from. Navigate to <code class=\"language-text\">/public/actions/index.js</code>. Here you will find an incomplete list of all the Redux actions that this application can perform. The core idea behind Redux is that every state change in the application can only occur through the dispatching of a registered action. This way, you can very easily predict the lifecycle of your application over time, and you do away with state mutation complications altogether (more on this later).</p>\n<p>The structure of a Redux application is such that every time an action is dispatched (with some optional data passed along with it), a Redux reducer function will take the current state and the recently dispatched action and compute the <em>new</em> state in a predictable way. The only way to change state is via an action to the reducer.</p>\n<p>Notice that in the entry file <code class=\"language-text\">main.jsx</code>, we initialize a variable called <code class=\"language-text\">store</code> by passing <code class=\"language-text\">Redux.createStore</code> our <code class=\"language-text\">mainReducer</code> function, exported from <code class=\"language-text\">/reducers/index.js</code>. Also note that we pass it our initial application state, too. This is how you initialize the base structure for a Redux application.</p>\n<h3>0.2 Example of Dispatching of Redux Action to Redux Reducer</h3>\n<p>To illustrate the role of the reducer in the application, consider the following example. First, the run button located in the main React component, <code class=\"language-text\">GameOfLife</code>, is clicked. The click handler on the <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;button&gt;</code> in that component then calls some function that uses the <code class=\"language-text\">store</code> prop in the <code class=\"language-text\">GameOfLife</code> component to dispatch an event of the form <code class=\"language-text\">action.run()</code>. This then dispatches a <code class=\"language-text\">RUN</code> action to to our main reducer (registered in <code class=\"language-text\">main.jsx</code>, defined in <code class=\"language-text\">/public/reducers/index.js</code>).</p>\n<p>Now, our reducer is called with the current state of the application and the result of <code class=\"language-text\">action.run()</code> (an object of the form <code class=\"language-text\">{ type: &#39;RUN&#39; }</code>) as parameters. The job of the reducer is to determine how to compute the <em>next</em> state based on the current state, the action just performed, and any additional data (which would be located in the action object if it existed).</p>\n<p>Because Redux does not let you mutate state directly, any changes in application state require that the state object be rebuilt entirely. This is most easily done by using an immutability helper of some sort, or, in our case, lodash's <a href=\"https://lodash.com/docs#assign\"><code class=\"language-text\">_.assign</code></a> function.</p>\n<p>Anyway, once the reducer returns the next state, Redux will re-render the application with the new state and wait for more actions to be dispatched.</p>\n<p><em>Note: If you still don't feel totally comfortable with Redux, we recommend you try reading the <a href=\"http://redux.js.org/index.html\">Redux documentation</a>.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Part 1.1 - Setting up the Redux Actions</h2>\n<p>First, we want to decide on our <a href=\"http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html\">Redux Actions</a>.\nEach action object describes an event that has occurred in the application and contains a <code class=\"language-text\">type</code> and any additional information.</p>\n<p>Again, the idea is that when an event occurs that changes the application state, an action of a particular type gets dispatched to the Redux reducer, and the application state is updated accordingly.</p>\n<p>Navigate to <code class=\"language-text\">/public/actions/index.js</code> to fill out the remaining action creator functions. We've implemented a couple of them for you, but you'll need to do the rest.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Part 1.2 - Setting up the UI and Initial State</h2>\n<p>Now that we've enumerated all possible actions that can lead to state changes in our application, we're prepared to begin building out the UI.</p>\n<h3>Part 1.2.1 - Writing the Markup for GameOfLife.jsx</h3>\n<p>First, navigate to <code class=\"language-text\">/public/components/GameOfLife.jsx</code> and complete the <code class=\"language-text\">render</code> function that generates the component's JSX.</p>\n<h3>Part 1.2.2 - Writing the Markup for Cell.jsx</h3>\n<p>Now, head over to <code class=\"language-text\">/public/components/Cell.jsx</code> and complete the render function as specified in the TODO comments.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Part 1.3 - Implementing the Redux Reducer</h2>\n<p>So far, we've defined all the Actions that can change the state of the app, and we've built React components to display the game board and its cells.</p>\n<p>Now, it's time to finally handle those actions!</p>\n<p>Head over to <code class=\"language-text\">/public/reducers/index.js</code> and follow the instructions in the comments for completing the action handlers in the reducer.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Submitting to GradeScope</h2>\n<p>Yay! You're done.</p>\n<p>Run the following:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">gulp compile\ngulp zip</code></pre></div>\n<p>And then upload the <code class=\"language-text\">files.zip</code> archive that is created to gradescope.\n<strong>Note:</strong> please do not attempt to zip the files from the GUI, or using any other zip utility. Only use gulp.

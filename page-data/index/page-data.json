Location Towne 309.</strong></p>\n<p>This course provides an introduction to modern JavaScript: frameworks, design patterns, techniques, and best practices used to create robust applications both server-side and client-side. The emphasis will be on sampling a wide range of JavaScript use cases. The topics covered will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>JavaScript language</li>\n<li>Web browser internals, the Document Object Model (DOM), jQuery, HTTP requests</li>\n<li>Webkit developer tools &#x26; JS debugging</li>\n<li>MV* frameworks (ReactJS)</li>\n<li>Client-side app architecture, modular JS development &#x26; best practices</li>\n<li>Server-side app architecture (with ExpressJS), middleware, and RESTful API design</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This course is most useful for students who have some programming and web development experience and want to develop moderate JavaScript skills to be able to build complex, interactive applications.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CIS 120 or equivalent (or permission of instructor).</li>\n<li>Some knowledge of HTML/CSS (if you don't meet this requirement, you are expected to pick up the basics on your own with online resources like <a href=\"http://codecademy.com/\">Codecademy</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">Mozilla Developer Network</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Policies</h3>\n<p>Homework will be graded out of 25 points: 15 for correctness (automatically graded), 5 for JavaScript best practices (automatically graded), and 5 for code style (manually graded). Grading will follow the <a href=\"https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis197/assignments/style\">style guide for the course</a> - please ask on Piazza if you have a specific question that is not covered here.</p>\n<p>Please note that the code style grade is additive, not subtractive; if you do not complete a homework, you will not receive 5 style points for ‘making no errors,’ but rather 0 style points for writing no code at all.</p>\n<p>You have two <strong>free</strong> late days to use throughout the course. After this, late submissions will be docked <strong>20%</strong> for every day late. Additional extensions will <em><strong>only</strong></em> be granted in truly extenuating circumstances.</p>\n<p>If a submission doesn't run (i.e. has syntax errors), we will not be lenient -- you will likely receive zero credit. Please start assignments early and use office hours to your advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>See the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DwJdajfsy1oYJrWG3XY80T3I-TNlaJLowbS8kM2m4KY&#x26;authuser=0\">course syllabus</a> for more detailed policies and grading info.</strong></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 29, 2019","path":"/","title":"Programação para Internet I","metaTitle":"ADS 2020.1"}}},"pageContext":{}}}

# Homeworks
* Due at midnight
  * Two **free** late days with no deductions
  * After this, 20% deducted for each day late
  * Additional late days for extenuating circumstances *only*
    * Holidays and classwork are *not* extenuating
* Grade breakdown (out of 25):
  * 15 points for correctness (autograded)
  * 5 points for best practices (autograded)
  * 5 points for code style (manually graded)

Style grades are **addititive**, not **subtractive**; an incomplete assignment is worth zero points.

## ESLint

# Academic Integrity

* Don't copy/paste code from online sources
* Don't have "mid-level" discussions
  * High-level: What's this homework about?
  * Low-level: What is the syntax for XYZ in JavaScript?
  * Mid-level (**bad**): How did you do the XML parser for HW2?
* It's *really easy* to detect plagiarism - just don't copy code
